  <p> Kane Williamson: It’s been quite a challenge for us, we need to come up with ways to reverse that pressure and turn around. 
      These have been par totals, the batting has been quality, but as a unit there are areas to touch on. 
      I think earlier in the competition when there was assistance with the new ball we were certainly very threatening, 
      so we need to go back to the drawing board as we have a little gap between the next game. 
      We will have to get a bit more creative and come up with ways to change the momentum. 
      Today we were outplayed, RCB are a really strong side, in fact all teams are strong. 
      For us it’s about looking to stay calm. We do need to improve, but don’t need to overthink. 
      The margins are always fine, but we need to show signs of improvement. We didn’t get off to a great start, 
      they had a very good total on that surface. It was holding a bit, and it was turning a bit, the wicket. 
      We needed to build some partnerships and take the game deep in order to maximise the opportunities on this Wankhede ground,
       but we were unable to do that. A lot of learning, we were outplayed like I said, but we do have a gap.
        So it’s important for us to reassess and we need to be clear how we target our next matches and take it positively.
         I’m not sure exactly, but I think they (Jansen, Natarajan) are recovering pretty well. 
         Certainly hoping to see them again soon.</p>

     <h2>Performance of SRH bowlers</h2>
     <ul>
         <li>Bhuvi</li>
         Bhuvi's mojo was'nt visible in this match.<br><br>
         <li>Umran</li>
         Josh Hazlewood: He (Umran Malik) will learn along the way and get better. Pace on ball was probably the easiest to hit.

         <li>Tyagi</li>
         Tyagi was vapid as usual<br>
         <li>Farooqi</li>
         Farooqi was good in his first spell. In his second spell, he was slammed by DK.

     Heartbreak of RCB:<br>
     J Suchith to Kohli, out Caught by Williamson!! 
     Kohli gone first ball of the match! It's such a soft dismissal. 
     The ball is drifting into the pads, and Kohli flicks it straight to short midwicket.
      He does a facepalm on his way back as his miserable run continues. Kohli c Williamson b J Suchith 0(1)<br><br>
